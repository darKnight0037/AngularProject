<p> When a user interacts with an application in the form of a keyboard movement, a mouse click, or a mouseover, it generates
    an event.
</p>
<p>These events need to be handled to perform some kind of action.</p>
<p>This is where event binding comes into picture.</p>
<div> Months :
    <select (change) = "changemonths($event)">
       <option *ngFor = "let i of months">{{i}}</option>
    </select>
 </div>

 <div>
    <span *ngIf = "isavailable; then condition1 else condition2">
       Condition is valid.
    </span>
    <ng-template #condition1>Condition is valid</ng-template>
    <ng-template #condition2>Condition is invalid</ng-template>
 </div>
 
 <button (click) = "myClickFunction($event)">Click Me</button>
